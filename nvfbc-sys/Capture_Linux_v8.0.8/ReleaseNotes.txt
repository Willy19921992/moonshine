Introduction

This is release 8.0.8 of Linux Capture SDK. 

Applications built with an earlier version of the Capture SDK(formerly known as GRID SDK) are guaranteed to
work with the graphics driver supported by the Capture SDK 8.0.8. Whereas, 
applications built with the Capture SDK 8.0.8 are not guaranteed to work with
an older driver.

This package contains:

1) NVFBC (NVIDIA Framebuffer Capture) API header
   [./NvFBC/inc/NvFBC.h]

2) NVFBC (NVIDIA Framebuffer Capture) API Reference Manual
   [./NvFBC/docs/NVFBC_v.8.0.8.pdf]

3) Sample application source code:

   These are the sample applications to demonstrate how to use the Capture SDK API

   [./NvFBC/samples/NvFBCCUDAAsync]
     This sample demonstrates how to use NvFBC to asynchronously grab
     frames to video memory then save them to the disk.

   [./NvFBC/samples/NvFBCMultiThread]
     This sample demonstrates how to use NvFBC to grab frames in
     parallel to system memory then save them to the disk.

   [./NvFBC/samples/NvFBCSharedContext]
     This sample demonstrates how a main thread can create a FBC context,
     then create a worker thread that performs the capture.

   [./NvFBC/samples/NvFBCToGL]
     This sample demonstrates how to use NvFBC to grab frames to 
     an OpenGL texture in video memory.

   [./NvFBC/samples/NvFBCToGLEnc]
     This sample demonstrates how to use NvFBC to grab frames to an OpenGL
     texture in video memory and send them to the HW encoder using
     NvEncodeAPI's OpenGL interface.

6) SUPPORTED HARDWARE
   
   Capture SDK can be only used on GRID, Tesla, or Quadro X2000+ (X = K/M/P/RTX
   etc) hardware products. Other configurations are not permitted under the end 
   user license agreement terms and conditions.

   Please refer the Driver related documentation if particular GPU is supported 
   or not for the driver in use.
